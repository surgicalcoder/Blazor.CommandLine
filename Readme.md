Built upon the great work by [Arda](https://github.com/ardacetinkaya) in their [Blazor.Console](https://github.com/ardacetinkaya/Blazor.Console) project, this converts it slightly to work in the browser.

### Why do you have a deps folder? Why have you not used nuget?

Because those libraries that are in use had to be ... adapted to work in the browser. And I'm lazy.

## How do I get it?

It's available on Nuget - [![NuGet version (GoLive.Blazor.Console)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/GoLive.Blazor.Console.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GoLive.Blazor.Console/)
